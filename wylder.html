            <p>
            A young man long in pursuit of the Nightlord. This swordsman has defied death at every turn with his stunning sixth sense for combat. He swore to avenge the Night in the name of his massacred tribe.
            </p>
            <p>
            His attributes are balanced throughout maturation, with excellent HP, strength, and dexterity. Able to command all types of melee weapons.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="descriptionBox">
          As the poster child of ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN, the Wylder is a versatile <a href="wylder.html">Nightfarer</a> who is reliable in all situations of the game. His outstanding strength and dexterity allow him to use any melee weapon at his disposal to great effect, and his unique character skills provide significant benefits in situations both in and out of combat.
        </p>
        <h3>Sixth Sense</h3>
        <p class="descriptionBox">
          Wylder's passive ability, Sixth Sense, allows him to automatically avoid a single fatal attack. This ability can be recharged by visiting a Site of Grace. It is particularly useful when navigating unfamiliar enemy matchups, or as a way to identify which attacks will kill the player in a single hit.
        </p>
        <h3>Claw Shot</h3>
        <p class="descriptionBox">
          Claw Shot is Wylder's Character Skill (activated by pressing Triangle + L2). It launches a grappling hook at wherever the camera is pointed (or whatever Wylder is locked on to). This grappling hook has a multitude of applications in a variety of situations: It will pull Wylder towards bosses and large enemies to close distance, or pull smaller enemies towards him to bring them in range of his powerful melee attacks. The Claw Shot can also be used to traverse the map quicker than other characters, pulling Wylder forwards and allowing him to perform a far-reaching jump if timed correctly. It can even rip away the guard of a blocking enemy to open them up for a critical hit. Effective use of the Claw Shot is vital to maximising Wylder's potential.
        </p>
        <h3>Onslaught Stake</h3>
        <p class="descriptionBox">
          Wylder's Ultimate Art is Onslaught Stake (activated by pressing Triangle + R2). It creates a powerful close-range explosion that has significant recoil unless charged. Onslaught Stake deals a huge amount of damage and contributes heavily to breaking a key target's posture. It can be used to interrupt attacks that may make it harder for Wylder's teammates to damage their target, or to clear out a mob of enemies. Onslaught Stake can be used out of grapples, jumps and grapple-jumps, making it a reliable way  to enter the fray safely. Use it wisely and your team will thank you for it!
