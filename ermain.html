          <h3><i>"The fallen leaves tell a story..."</i></h3>
          <p>
            In the Lands Between, on a fateful night, the demigod Godwyn the
            Golden was murdered in a plot known as the Night of the Black
            Knives. Soon after, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and her
            remaining demigod children vied for power, fighting over the
            remaining shards of the Elden Ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their newfound power led to a terrible war known as The Shattering,
            an endless war with no victor. Queen Marika has vanished, and the
            land, now godless, has been abandoned by the Greater Will. It is
            here that the game begins, with the traces of a once-lost grace
            raising the Tarnished inhabitants from their graves to mend the
            Elden Ring, and restore Order to the Lands Between.
